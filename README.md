# better-italian-layout
This is a custom Italian keyboard layout for all us beloved Italian developers which adds essential missing keys from the standard layout.
I'm publishing this in the hope to help other people and also in the hope that manufacters listen to the feedback and update their own layouts.

This layout was made with [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).
I'm open for feedback.

To install go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Leone25/better-italian-layout/releases) and download the latest `.zip` file. Extract it and run the `setup.exe`.

## Installation
In case you do not trust my own `.exe` file or you wish to make modifications your self I also provide the original `.klc` file which you can open with MSKLC and compile your self by going to `Project > Build DLL and Setup Package`.
